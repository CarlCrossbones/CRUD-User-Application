# Requirements
Create a CRUD application that allows users to be created and updated within a system. In this scenario, let's say a user has a name, age, and birth state. The application should:
- Create a public project in your github account
- Create all CRUD operations with endpoints so that they can be tested with Postman or a curl
- Create a backend container to house the CRUD operations
- Create a database container of your choice to store and manipulate new and existing users
- Utilize Docker for containerization
- Create a docker-compose file to spin up both containers
- Implement coding standards
- Create integration tests
- Compose a readme that shows how to test and run the application
- Feel free to add anything if time permists
- Complete by 6/30 end of day.
